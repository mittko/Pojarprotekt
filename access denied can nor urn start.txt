Resolving The Problem
To resolve the problem add grant permission to the java policy file <TDI_HOME>/jvm/jre/lib/security/java.policy as in the following two examples:

1. using java policy tool <TDI_HOME>/jvm/jre/bin/policytool:

Permission: java.net.SocketPermission
Target Name: localhost:1527
Actions: listen, resolve

which should add the following lines into java.policy file:

grant {
permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:1527", "listen, resolve";
};

2. using any editor and inserting the following single line into the list of existing granted permissions:

permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:1527", "listen, resolve";

Note: permission, host, port and actions in above two examples are based on the exception from Symptom above.
